## How it works

The rotary encoder adds/subtracts from a variable that determines which LED to turn on. Periodically, the chip sends out a signal for 12 LEDs out via ``uo0``, according to the WS2812B protocol. Further, the register value of the variable will be put out via ``uo2`` to ``uo5``. The button connected to ``in2`` toggles the LEDs.

## How to test

Connect the rotary encoder outputs to ``in0`` and ``in1``. If your rotary encoder also has a built in push button, conntect that to ``in2``, or use another switch with a pull down resistor.
The LEDs should be wired in series. The first LED's ``DIN`` input needs to be connected to the ``uo0`` (``out0``) of the chip.

Give the project a reset after power up and then rotate the encoder back and forth to see the light moving.

## External hardware

1. A rotary encoder.

3. Any arrangement of 12 WS2812B like controlled LEDs. More or less will also work, you will just not get the full range, or some LEDs will stay off.
